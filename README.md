## Installation

- Ubuntu 

## Dependencies

Some parts of the project are not representing by source code:
- DEPTH, the pc the backend stack runs on, is a debian installation
- relies on `depth-srv` docker-compose repo being run on same machine (mosquitto)
- OBS
  - Used compositing the live stream
  - Installed with flatpak, specifically the 2023-12-11 version. WARNING: newer versions break the gstreamer plugin currently (08/10/2024)
  - require gstreamer plugin
  - profile and scene collections are in `resources/obs`

## Instructions

### scripts

- `./scripts/dev/mount-md0` - mount DEPTH's filesystem locally, /mnt/md0/light-stores
- `./scripts/dev/extras-update` - render protos and xlangconsts, copying to everywhere necessary.
- `./scripts/dev/update-depth` - update depth with latest version of the backend systems
- `./scripts/dev/cloud-certs` - update webrtc.gregstretton.org certs for when the webcam stream fails on the cloud system
- `./scripts/dev/cloud-update` - update asol.gregstretton.org interface with latest build from github action

### .env settings

These are the environment variables used, and they default to the following in the docker-compose:

TOP_CAM=/dev/video2
FRONT_CAM=/dev/video0
LIGHT_STORES_DIR=/mnt/md0/light-stores/

### kv/ settings:

There's a key-value store in e.g. `/mnt/md0/light-stores/kv/` with most configuration.

- ENABLE_CONTENT_SCHEDULER_LOOP: controls whether the content scheduler loop will run to automatically upload at regular intervals
- ENABLE_SCHEDULER: controls whether the scheduler will run, which automatically runs sessions each week

## Sub-Systems

- [interface](interface/) - A React.JS interface for local control of embedded and backend systems.
- [services](services/)
	- [pygateway](services/pygateway/) - Serial-MQTT bridge for the firmware interface
	- [rtsp](services/rtsp/) - [MediaMTX](https://github.com/aler9/mediamtx) instance for video stream multiplexing
	- [goo](services/goo/) - Bulk of the runtime backend logic is here
	- [dslrcapture](services/dslrcapture/) - Separate service for capturing DSLR images in a loop while session is live.
- [tools](tools/)
	- [content_generation_dslr_edit.py](tools/content_generation_dslr_edit.py) - for post-processing of the dslr images
	- [content_generation_video.py](tools/content_generation_video.py) - for generating video content
	- [content_generation_timelapse.py](tools/content_generation_timelapse.py) - for generating timelapses from all the top-down dslr images

## Storage

Currently all data is stored to disk at the `-basePath` provided to _goo_.

`basePath`:
- session_content/
	- 1/
	- 2/
- session_metadata/
	- 1.yml
	- 2.yml
- kv/ (key-value storage for crop config etc.)
	- crop_dslr
	- crop_front-cam
	- crop_top-cam

Each `session_content` folder has the following format (output content in bold):

- state-reports.yml
- dispense-metadata.yml
- dslr/
	- raw/
		- 0001.jpg
		- 0001.jpg.creationtime
		- 0001.jpg.yml (crop info)
	- post/
		- **selected/**
- video/
	- raw/
		- front-cam/
		- top-cam/
	- post/
		- **CONTENT_TYPE.i.mp4**
- stills/
	- **INTRO/OUTRO-LANDSCAPE/PORTRAIT.jpg**
