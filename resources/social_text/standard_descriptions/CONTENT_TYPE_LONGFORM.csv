"A Study of Light automates exploration into the effects of changes in surface tension in fluid mixtures. This experiment is often known as the ""Magic Milk” experiment. The emulsifier (dish soap) changes the surface tension and interacts with the fats in the milk, causing incredible patterns to emerge."
